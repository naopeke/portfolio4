        <p class="message">
            I'm a QA Engineer with a strong passion for software quality assurance, based in Valencia, Spain. With a full-stack development background gained through an intensive bootcamp , I bring a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development lifecycle from both technical and quality perspectives.
            <br>
            <br>My journey into QA testing began in April 2024, and since then I've been conducting manual and automated testing across multiple platforms as a freelance tester. I specialize in functional testing, accessibility validation, and mobile testing, using tools like Playwright for test automation, NVDA and VoiceOver for accessibility compliance, and Android Studio with Appium for mobile device validation.
            <br>         
            <br>During my internship as a QA E2E Tester, I developed and executed comprehensive test cases based on user stories and requirements, working closely with the development team to identify and resolve issues proactively. This experience reinforced my belief that quality assurance is not just about finding bugs—it's about collaborating with teams to build better software from the ground up.
            With my background spanning full-stack development and quality engineering, I understand both the developer's perspective when writing code and the tester's mindset when validating it. This dual perspective allows me to bridge the gap between development and QA teams effectively, facilitating clear communication and driving continuous improvement in software quality.
            <br>
            <br>I'm proficient in using Jira and Azure DevOps for test management and defect tracking, and I'm experienced in designing test cases, executing regression testing, and delivering timely, accurate test results. My technical skills include TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, and various testing frameworks, combined with a detail-oriented approach and commitment to ensuring software meets the highest standards of quality and security.
            <br>
            <br>In my previous career in Customer Support and BtoB Marketing, communication and stakeholder management were paramount. Now I combine that professional communication experience with my technical expertise in QA, enabling me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, document issues clearly, and contribute to a culture of quality-driven development.
            <br>
            <br>I'm multilingual (native Japanese, bilingual in English and Spanish), which allows me to work seamlessly in diverse, international environments and communicate effectively across cultural boundaries.
